## System Architecture

### Hardware Setup

The experimental hardware consisted of two ESP32–CP2102 modules, configured as transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX), for wireless signal transmission and reception. Two laptops were used: Laptop 1 ran the transmitter script via VS Code, connected to the ESP32 TX module through a USB cable, while Laptop 2 ran the receiver script via Arduino IDE, connected to the ESP32 RX module. Laptop 2 also handled data acquisition and storage. A monitor and USB interfaces were used to monitor and control the data collection process. The ESP32 modules were positioned 11 meters apart at a height of 1.5 meters.

**Hardware Components:**
- **ESP32 TX Module**: Transmitter connected to Laptop 1 via USB cable
- **ESP32 RX Module**: Receiver connected to Laptop 2 via USB cable  
- **Laptop 1**: Running transmitter script via VS Code
- **Laptop 2**: Running receiver script via Arduino IDE, handling data acquisition
- **IP Webcam**: Android device for synchronized video recording
- **Network Infrastructure**: WiFi networks for device communication

### Software Setup

The software architecture consists of multiple layers to support data collection, processing, and visualization. The ESP32 modules communicate via two separate Wi-Fi networks: Network A for the Android IP Webcam, and Network B for the ESP32–laptop communication. The backend, implemented using Flask, handles data collection, storage, and exposes RESTful API endpoints. A data processing pipeline performs signal processing, feature extraction, synchronization, and analysis. The frontend mobile application, developed in React Native, provides the interface for data management and network configuration.

### Data Collection Protocol

**People Counting Methodology:**
- Manual counting and validation by trained researchers
- Ground truth verification through synchronized video recordings
- Precise people counting with timestamp-based synchronization (<50ms accuracy)
- Cross-validation of occupancy counts by multiple annotators
- Consistent counting protocol across all recording sessions

**Collection Environment:**
- Indoor laboratory setting (5m × 4m room)
- Controlled lighting and environmental conditions
- ESP32 positioned at fixed location (1.5m height) for optimal CSI coverage
- IP Webcam recording at 30 FPS with timestamp logging for ground truth
- Standardized people positioning and movement patterns for each occupancy level

**Ethical Considerations:**
- Data collected with informed consent from all participants
- No personally identifiable information stored
- Privacy-preserving methodology using WiFi signals instead of facial recognition
- Compliance with institutional research ethics guidelines
- Anonymous data sharing for research purposes only
